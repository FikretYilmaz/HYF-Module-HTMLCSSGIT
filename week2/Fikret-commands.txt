cd ==> I use this command for "change (current) my directory". It is the one of the most useful commands in the Gitbash. Also use "cd .." to go back to parent directory

mkdir ==> I use this command to "make a new directory(folder)".
With "mkdir -p parent/child1/child1-A/..." we can create multiple nested directories.

rm ==> "remove" With this command "rm <filename> we can delete a file. Also use "rm *" we can delete all of file in our current directory
